# Calculator_java_project

This is my first Java project â€” a simple calculator built using Java and developed in Visual Studio Code. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helped me understand Java fundamentals, user input handling, and basic logic building.
